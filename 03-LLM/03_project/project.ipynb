    "I am use Character Description dataset (character_descriptions.csv) which provides details about artist, genre and their location. It also describes the artist accomplishments and a brief backgroud about he artist. I want to explore how openai pretrained models can undertand these details with basic and custom prompts. I will be asking questions which has to infered with the data provided and not explisit. This will help us deomostrate the effectivness of Generative model. There are 55 entries in the dataset which gives a good sample for the the LLM to understand the trend of the data. To make this dataset usable, there were multiple cleaning steps that had to be done. I cleaned up the rows which had empty fields and created a text column in pandas tha would combine \"Name, Description, Medium and Setting in the data set. This was used to create embeddings."
